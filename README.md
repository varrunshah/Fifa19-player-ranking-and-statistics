# FIFA19 Player rankings and other Statistics
FIFA19 is a data visualization project in which we can assess the player's ranking, ratings, and other statistics with the help of visualization tools. Also creating an innovative dashboard that will show us the different statistics and key information about the world class players. 
Football players are the most valuable asset for any team. Therefore, it is extremely beneficial and important to predict the value of a player and find players who have the potential to become future stars using data analytics. 
# Data
We have used FIFA 2019 Player Statistics data extracted from [kaggle](https://kaggle.com).      Our dataset contains playing attributes of the player for 2019. We have 75 variables and 17,981 records. For the purpose of our analysis we did not consider the position and goal keeper features. Also, there were too many variables to perform any meaningful analysis, so we performed feature selection to reduce our variable count to 39.
# System Requirements
- R 3.6
- Rstudio 3.5.2
- Tableau desktop 2019.3
# Libraries
- .libPath() - all the functions and packages from R studio is defined and installed inside this folder.
# Execution 
Well, the execution of the project is done with the combination of R and tableau desktop.
The attached Tableau notebook has all the work done in making of this project along with the RMD file.
# Challenges
The major challenge was based on the dataset. Since we had approx. 18000 records and few of the records had null values. Also some columns needed to be converted to its appropriate data type
# Insights
We performed supervised as well as unsupervised learning techniques to carry out our exploratory analysis. There were a few models applied to get the desired output. 
From our supervised learning analysis, we found ‘potential’, ‘ball control’, and ‘reaction’ attributes are the most influential factors on deciding the value of a player. Whereas, certain group of players who are currently of low value but has a lot of potential to be the future stars.

The tableau notebook has all the data visualisations for this particular project.
